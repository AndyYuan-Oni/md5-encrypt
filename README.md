# md5-encrypt

A small handy tool to encrypt md5

## Intro

This is a super tiny page, can have a try [here](https://andyyuan-oni.github.io/md5-encrypt/).

It is just a small pracise and trying to understand the concept of MD5. Got some instructions on the others' works. And some times there is the need of some MD5 code fast for testing.

Anyway, tiny practise that's it.

## Others

It's totally on client side.
